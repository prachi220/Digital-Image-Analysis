This involves the implementation of [Guo, Dong, and Terence Sim. “Digital face makeup by example.” Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2009. CVPR 2009. IEEE Conference on. IEEE, 2009](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~tsim/documents/face_makeup_cvpr09_lowres.pdf), creating face makeup upon a face image with another image as the style example. This is similar to physical makeup as the color and skin details are modified while preserving the face structure. 
The two images are first decomposed into three layers: face structure layer, skin detail layer, and color layer. Thereafter, information from each layer of one image is transferred to corresponding layer of the other image.
