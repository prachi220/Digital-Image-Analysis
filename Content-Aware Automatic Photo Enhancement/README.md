This involves the implementation of [Kaufman, Liad, Dani Lischinski, and Michael Werman. "Content‚ÄêAware Automatic Photo Enhancement." Computer Graphics Forum. Vol. 31. No. 8. Oxford, UK: Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2012](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.386.4616&rep=rep1&type=pdf), which aims at designing a new framework for automatic photo enhancement that attempts to take local and global image semantics into account. The content-aware scheme should detect and enhance the appearance of human faces, blue skies with or without clouds, and underexposed salient regions.
